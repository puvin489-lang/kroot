# kroot

Root cause analysis for Kubernetes incidents.

`kroot` is a Rust CLI that analyzes Kubernetes resources,
builds dependency graphs, and explains _why failures occur_.

Instead of only detecting symptoms, `kroot` builds a dependency graph
and traces resource relationships to explain root causes.

## TL;DR

```bash
kroot diagnose cluster -A
```

Find root causes for Kubernetes failures using dependency-aware analysis.

## How kroot Works

`kroot` analyzes a cluster in three stages:

1. Collect Kubernetes resources (pods, services, secrets, and related objects).
2. Build a dependency graph between resources.
3. Run analyzers that detect failure patterns and trace root causes.

This allows `kroot` to report not just failing resources, but the dependency chains that explain the failure.

## Why kroot

Most Kubernetes tooling tells you _what failed_.
`kroot` is designed to explain _why it failed_ by correlating resources and their relationships.

Example chain:

`Pod/prod/payments-api -> Secret/prod/db-password -> Secret missing`

## Features

- Graph-first diagnosis pipeline using `petgraph`
- 12 built-in analyzers for common production failure patterns
- Upstream root-cause traversal to first broken dependency
- Directional NetworkPolicy reachability RCA with peer + port simulation
  (namespace/pod selectors, named ports/ranges, and ipBlock-aware reasoning)
- Blast-radius analysis with ranked impact scoring for pods/services/deployments/ingresses
- Confidence scoring for diagnoses and dependency traces
- Suggested remediation output (summary + steps, optional command snippets)
- Text report output for humans
- JSON output for automation and CI systems
- SARIF output for CI and security/dev tooling pipelines
- Online mode (live cluster via `kube-rs`)
- Offline mode (`--context-file`) for deterministic debugging and tests
- Modular crate layout for collectors, graph, engine, and analyzers

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust (stable)
- Access to a Kubernetes cluster and kubeconfig (`kubectl` context)

### Build and run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnonJon/kroot
cd kroot
cargo build --workspace
```

### Install binary from source

```bash
cargo install --path cli
```

### Install from source repository (single command)

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/AnonJon/kroot --bin kroot
```

Then run:

```bash
kroot --help
```

## Quick Start

Diagnose current namespace from your active kubeconfig context:

```bash
cargo run -p kroot -- diagnose cluster
```

Diagnose a specific pod:

```bash
cargo run -p kroot -- diagnose pod payments-api -n prod
```

Diagnose all namespaces with fix guidance and command snippets:

```bash
cargo run -p kroot -- diagnose cluster -A --show-commands
```

## When to Use kroot

`kroot` is useful when:

- a pod is failing but the root cause is unclear
- service traffic suddenly stops working
- cluster issues need quick triage during incidents
- you want automated analysis instead of manual `kubectl` debugging

Typical workflow:

1. Run `kroot diagnose cluster`.
2. Inspect dependency traces.
3. Identify the upstream failing resource.

## Example Output

```text
$ kroot diagnose cluster -n prod

Diagnosis Report
----------------

3 issues detected

CRITICAL Pod/prod/payments-api -> Missing Secret dependency detected
  Root cause: Pod failing because secret db-password does not exist
WARNING Service/prod/payments -> Service selector mismatch detected
  Root cause: Service selector does not match any pod labels
WARNING Pod/prod/payments-api -> Network reachability blocked by NetworkPolicy
  Root cause: Ingress/egress rules do not permit required peer and port communication

Dependency Traces:
  [0.90] Pod/prod/payments-api -> NetworkPolicy/prod/deny-all -> NetworkPolicy denies traffic (source: networkpolicy.egress) (egress has no matching peers/ports in context policies=[NetworkPolicy/prod/deny-all])

Blast Radius:
  [#1 score=14.70 conf=0.98] NetworkPolicy/prod/deny-all
    pods=1 services=0 deployments=1 ingresses=0
    impacted pods: Pod/prod/payments-api
    impacted deployments: Deployment/prod/payments-api

Suggested Fixes:
  Missing Secret dependency detected (Pod/prod/payments-api)
    Summary: Create the missing Secret or update pod references
  Network reachability blocked by NetworkPolicy (Pod/prod/payments-api)
    Summary: Allow required peer and port combinations in NetworkPolicy
```

## Command Reference

### Diagnose cluster

```bash
kroot diagnose cluster [-n <namespace> | -A] [--output text|json|sarif] [--context-file <path>] [--show-fixes <bool>] [--show-commands <bool>]
```

### Diagnose pod

```bash
kroot diagnose pod <name> [-n <namespace>] [--output text|json|sarif] [--context-file <path>] [--show-fixes <bool>] [--show-commands <bool>]
```

### Notes

- `cluster` scope defaults to your current namespace (or `-n` if provided).
- use `-A`/`--all-namespaces` for a cross-namespace cluster scan.
- `--context-file` bypasses cluster calls and runs analyzers against JSON context input.
- `--show-fixes` controls suggested remediation sections in text output (default: `true`).
- `--show-commands` includes remediation command snippets in text output (default: `false`).

## Output Formats

### Text (default)

Human-readable diagnosis report with:

- issue summary
- root cause statements
- evidence lines
- dependency traces
- blast-radius impact sections
- suggested remediation guidance

### JSON

Machine-readable output for scripting:

```bash
kroot diagnose cluster --output json -n prod
```

High-level JSON shape:

- `issue_count`
- `diagnoses[]`
- `diagnoses[].remediation`
- `dependency_traces[]`
- `blast_radius[]`

### SARIF

SARIF output is useful for CI systems and security/dev tooling pipelines:

```bash
kroot diagnose cluster --output sarif -A > kroot.sarif.json
```

SARIF properties include confidence, evidence, and remediation metadata when available.
When blast-radius data is present, SARIF results also include `impact_score` and `impact_rank`.

## Release Binaries and Package Managers

Release binaries are published on tagged releases (`v*`) through:

- [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](./.github/workflows/release.yml)
- [Latest release](https://github.com/AnonJon/kroot/releases/latest)

Available now:

- GitHub Releases assets (Linux/macOS/Windows archives)

Planned install paths:

- Homebrew tap formula (planned)
- Scoop manifest (planned)

## Offline Analysis

Run analysis against a previously captured context:

```bash
kroot diagnose cluster --context-file ./context.json
```

Example context fixture:

- [cli/tests/fixtures/cluster_context.json](./cli/tests/fixtures/cluster_context.json)

This is useful for:

- reproducible incident analysis
- CI validation of analyzer behavior
- sharing deterministic debugging artifacts

## Analyzer Coverage

Current built-in analyzers:

1. `CrashLoopBackOff`
2. `ImagePullBackOff / ErrImagePull`
3. `OOMKilled`
4. `Unschedulable Pod`
5. `Missing Secret`
6. `Missing ConfigMap`
7. `Failed Readiness Probe`
8. `Failed Liveness Probe`
9. `Service Selector Mismatch`
10. `PersistentVolume Mount Failure`
11. `Node NotReady`
12. `Network Reachability (NetworkPolicy peer + port simulation)`

Analyzer registry:

- [crates/analyzers/src/registry.rs](./crates/analyzers/src/registry.rs)

## Why not kubectl?

Typical manual flow:

```bash
kubectl describe pod payments-api -n prod
kubectl logs payments-api -n prod
kubectl get events -n prod
```

This surfaces symptoms, but usually not the full dependency cause chain.

`kroot` correlates dependencies directly:

`Pod/prod/payments-api -> Secret/prod/db-password -> Secret missing`

That gives a direct root-cause path instead of disconnected clues.

## Project Status

`kroot` is early-stage but functional for real diagnostics.

First public release: `v0.1.0` (March 8, 2026).

Current capabilities:

- cluster and pod diagnosis
- 12 built-in analyzers
- network reachability RCA for policy-blocked ingress/service/pod traffic paths
- dependency-graph-backed root-cause traversal
- blast-radius impact analysis
- remediation guidance with optional command suggestions
- JSON output for automation
- SARIF output for CI and tooling integrations
- offline context analysis via `--context-file`

Expect active iteration as graph coverage and reasoning depth expand.

## Similar Tools

`kroot` focuses on dependency-aware root cause analysis.

Related tools:

- `popeye` (cluster linting)
- `kube-score` (manifest/static analysis)
- `kubectl` (manual troubleshooting)

`kroot` complements these by correlating runtime relationships between resources.

## Kubernetes Permissions (RBAC)

`kroot` collects and correlates multiple resource types. Your identity should allow at least:

- `get/list` on `pods`
- `get/list` on `services`
- `get/list` on `events`
- `get/list` on `networkpolicies`
- `get/list` on `configmaps`
- `get/list` on `secrets`
- `get/list` on `persistentvolumeclaims`
- `get/list` on `persistentvolumes`
- `get/list` on `nodes`

If these are missing, output quality degrades and some diagnoses may be skipped or marked unknown.

## Architecture

Pipeline:

`CLI -> Collectors -> AnalysisContext -> DependencyGraph -> Analyzers -> Diagnoses`

Workspace crates:

- `cli`: binary crate (`kroot`)
- `crates/cluster`: Kubernetes collectors and context loading
- `crates/types`: normalized domain models
- `crates/graph`: dependency graph builder/model (`petgraph`)
- `crates/analyzers`: analyzer plugins
- `crates/engine`: orchestration and diagnosis execution

## Known Limitations

- NetworkPolicy reachability uses selector/peer/port simulation, but it is still context-bounded
  (no packet-level runtime capture and no CNI-specific enforcement introspection).
- Dependency graph coverage is intentionally focused on high-value relations (`Deployment -> ReplicaSet -> Pod`, `Ingress -> Service`, `Service -> Pod`, `Pod -> Secret/ConfigMap/PVC/Node`, `PVC -> PV`, `NetworkPolicy -> Pod`, `Service/Pod -> NetworkPolicy` blocked-path edges).
- Storage coverage includes `PVC -> StorageClass` and `PVC -> PV` relation analysis, but deeper storage topology reasoning is still limited.
- Blast-radius output currently tracks impacted `Pod`, `Service`, `Deployment`, and `Ingress` resources.
- Blast-radius for non-dependency diagnoses relies on diagnosis resource/evidence anchoring; impact quality depends on evidence richness.
- Kubernetes API permission gaps can reduce diagnosis quality (some dependencies may become unknown).
- Output schema is currently stable for this repo, but not yet versioned as a public API contract.

## Roadmap

Next milestones:

- Expand relation coverage (`StatefulSet/DaemonSet/Job -> Pod`, `IngressClass`, service-to-endpoint slice details).
- Expand blast-radius rollups (`StatefulSet`, `DaemonSet`, `Job`, and `Node` impact views).
- Extend reachability simulation with EndpointSlice-aware destination modeling and richer multi-rule policy conflict explanation.
- Version and document structured output schemas (JSON/SARIF) for external integrations.
- Add package-manager distribution (`homebrew`, `scoop`, `apt`/`rpm`).
